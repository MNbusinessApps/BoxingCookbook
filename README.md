## The Boxer's Philosophy

> "Every meal is an opportunity to fuel your championship dreams. Eat with purpose, eat with flavor, eat to win."

### Core Principles

1. **High Protein Intake** - 30-50g per serving to maximize muscle retention
2. **Low Carb Approach** - Fibrous vegetables only, no starchy carbs or sugars
3. **Healthy Fats** - Essential for hormone production and joint health
4. **Bold Flavors** - No compromise on taste for nutrition
